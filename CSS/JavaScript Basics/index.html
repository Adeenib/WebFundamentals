            <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;" class="text marg"> JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting
                language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and
                lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different
                directions. JavaScript lives inside a host
                environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to
                provide programmatic control over
                them.

            <ul class="text marg marg2">
                <li>Variable Declaration</span> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a
                    cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee,
                    a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These
                    unique names are called identifiers.<span> var x;</span>
                </li>

                <li>V<span class="defenision">Variable Assignment</span> Assignment operators assign values to
                    JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our
                    variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.<span> x =
                        10;</span>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <span class="defenision">Data Types</span> Data types are an important concept; to be able to
                    operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types
                    that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span>true</span> or <span>false</span>; null - null aka
                    nothing; Number - 42 or 3.14159; String - <span>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span>
                    Array - <span>[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span>{first_name: 'Jane',
                        last_name:'Doe'}</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="defenision">Conditionals</span> When you write code, you want to perform different
                    actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on
                    values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to
                    accomplish this. There are the following
                    conditional statements: <span>if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code
                    block; <span>else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first
                    condition is false; <span>else</span> we execute this block of code;
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="defenision">Loops</span> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming
                    language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat
                    an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four
                    times and then you stop. Thats a loop!
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="defenision">Function</span> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we
                    call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of
                    instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the
                    instruction manual and get started, first we
                    screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our
                    instructions. Sadly there are a ton more
                    tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.
